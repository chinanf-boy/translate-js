# Awesome Cold Showers

It's great when people get excited about things, but sometimes they get a little _too_ excited. This an awesome (rigorous and respectful) and curated (I read every suggestion and make judgement calls) list of cold showers on overhyped topics.This does **not** mean the enthusiasm is bad or wrong: we're just reminding people to stay grounded. Feel free to submit your favorites!

####  [Verification Techniques](http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/04_verif_techniques.pdf) (PDF)

* **Hype:** "Formal Verification is a great way to write software. We should prove all of our code correct."

* **Shower:** Extensive literature review showing that formal methods are hard to learn, extremely expensive to apply, and often miss critical bugs.

* **Caveats:** Written in 2000 and doesn't cover modern tools/techniques, such as TLA+ or dependent typing.

* **Notes:** Part of [Peter Gutmann](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/)'s thesis, "The Design and Verification of a Cryptographic Security Architecture".
